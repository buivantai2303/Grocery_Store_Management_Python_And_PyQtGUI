In a small village nestled in the heart of the mountains, there lived a young boy named Jack. He was known throughout the village for his kind heart and his love of animals.
One day, while exploring the woods near his home, Jack stumbled upon a wounded bird lying on the ground. Its wing was broken, and it could not fly.
Without hesitation, Jack scooped up the bird and brought it back to his home. He made a cozy nest for it in a shoebox and spent hours nursing it back to health.
As the days passed, Jack grew more and more attached to the bird. He named it Blue and would spend hours talking to it about his hopes and dreams.
Eventually, Blueâ€™s wing healed, and it was time for him to fly away. Jack knew that he would miss his feathered friend but was happy knowing that he had helped him when he needed it most.
